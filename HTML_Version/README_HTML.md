This was my starting point for web developement.

I learn about HTMl and how it is basically the skeleton of the website, very bare bones with it.
It was hard to complete the image I had in my head because of how very little customization that HTML allowed for.

Take Note: As this Summer Project continues on, I learn how to organize everything much better...

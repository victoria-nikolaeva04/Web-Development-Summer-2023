                                <dd>☆ This was the most recent poster I did for my studio. I only had the course of a week to come up and execute
                                    the poster, but I think it worked out in the end.

                                <dd>☆ Created this poster during my senior year of highschool, a contribute to my
                                    final year on the stage. Each of the different nutcracker represent the different levels for the classe
                                    in the studio It was a nice way to close the curtains.

                                <dd>☆ This was the first poster I did for the studio, which is a rip-off of Harry Potter. It is still one of my
                                    personal favorites that I have done.<br>
                                    &emsp;Fun Fact: This was the first time the logo was used, that I also created.

                            <dt>★<em><strong>Seussical the Musical</strong></em></dt>
                                <dd>☆ Seussical was created for my senior year spring musical, and it was an amazing opportunitity to take. I took alot of 
                                    inspiration of the orginal source material and wanted to focus on very bright colors.

                            <dt>★<em><strong>Nutcracker 2020</strong></em></dt>
                                <dd>☆ Honestly, this was not one of the best compare to others, I think I should have focus on the details and making things
                                    more clean and professional. Maybe I will take the time to redo it for fun.

                                <dd>☆ This poster was for a friend who was running a podcast; Personally, his podcast sucks but at least his logos
                                     and posters are top-tier</dd>

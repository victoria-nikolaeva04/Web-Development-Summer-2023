This version kept the CSS 0.2 basic structure but added functionality to the site.
To practice my upcoming knowledge & learning of JS, decided to make a fake shop

This fake shop contains four opinion of art, each with their title, image, price, and quanity properties
and I had to use JS to calculate and update these different properties for things like the overall cart button
or total price depending on the unit rate of the art and the quanity of said art.

This fake shop also help learn a bit more into other ideas like JSON and Web Storage, however
the main focus was learning the potential of JS.

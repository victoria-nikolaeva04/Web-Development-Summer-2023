                                &emsp; My name is <em>Victoria Nikolaeva</em>. I am currently a sophmore in 
                                <abbr title="Univeristy of Delaware">UD</abbr>, majoring in their Computer Science program for a BA degree.
                                I am honestly at a weird point of my life, many parts of my world and myself are changing. I lost some of the 
                                closest people in my life and I felt like I was in a void but what can you do, it is a part of life that I need
                                to accept. So, this summer is going to be about self improvement and reaching out to friends that have been kind to me
                                that I stupidly never gave the chance. This site is part of that journey of improvement. So...
                                <br><strong>Thank You for stoping by!</strong>

                                        <p>&nbsp;I have danced for about fourteen years. I started with ballet but moved into other styles like
                                            en pointe, modern, comptemporary, lyrical, jazz, and bits of hip-hop. Now that I have left for college
                                            I have been transitioning into yoga.

                                        <p>&nbsp;Similar to my passion for art, animation is one of the most incrediable forms of medias
                                            and I am constantly in awe of it. My favortie animated movie currently in <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em>
                                            but I also love <em>Howl's Moving Castle</em> and many animes too.

                                        <p>&nbsp;While I am more of a movie-lover, I do enjoy books of all sorts
                                            (comics, graphic novels, poerty, fansatsy, thriller, romance); My favortie book series
                                            is <em>The Infernal Devices</em> series by Cassandra Clare.S

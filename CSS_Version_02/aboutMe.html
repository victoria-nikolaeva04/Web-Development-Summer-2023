                    <h3>Victoria's Bio</h3>
                    <p>&emsp; My name is <em>Victoria Nikolaeva</em>. I am currently a student at Univeristy of Delaware, studying in 
                        their computer science BA program. I have a passion for art & design, which has influenced me into going into the 
                        feild of UX/UI design as a goal in my profession. Besides that, I am a 2-year old adult that is on her last year of being
                        a teen so I got to make it count for before I hit 20. Recently I have been going through some major character developement
                        so expect to see me level up in milestones and XP. Can't wait to take back my power!
                        <br><br><strong>&emsp; Thank You for stoping by!</strong></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;I LOVE art, I started drawing arounf the 4th grade when I was into the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>
                            I am into drawing characters mainly from my favortie medias; now I often use my skills for school</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;I have danced for about fourteen years. I started with ballet but moved into other styles like
                                en pointe, modern, comptemporary, lyrical, jazz, and bits of hip-hop. Now that I have left for college
                                I have been transitioning into yoga.

                            <p>&nbsp;Similar to my passion for art, animation is one of the most incrediable forms of medias
                                and I am constantly in awe of it. My favortie animated movie currently in <em>Into the Spider-Verse</em>
                                but I also love <em>Howl's Moving Castle</em> and many animes too.

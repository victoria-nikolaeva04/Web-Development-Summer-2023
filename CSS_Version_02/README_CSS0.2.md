This version started off fresh as it gave me more of a chance to think about and design
what I want this personal site was going to be about.

I was able to break down the visual parts more simply and understood better
how the elements mesh together to make a more aesthically pleasing website.

The hardest part of this version was creating the slide show without the 
assistance of JavaScript, however I manage to make it work with CSS's animation
properties.

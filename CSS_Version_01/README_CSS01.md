This was when I started to learn how to use CSS as a beautification process ontop of the existing HTML
from before.

This excerise help see me see the difference between just slapping something on top 
and to actually plan out a process while to keep many thing in mind
You will see how planing out improves the website wildly...

Keep in mind that the HTML files are almost exactly the same except minor tweaks to make
unqiue names for the style sheet.

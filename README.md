# Web-Development-Summer-2023
A simple beginner website focusing on learning. 

This repository shows the process of how I was learning the basics of many elements of website developement tools like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Web Storage, and JSON.
My goal was to focus on how these different elements react and mesh togteher to create a website that many see everyday on the Web.
I did this through iterations:
 - Begining of June: Focus on learning the skeleton of HTML
 - Mid-June to early July: Focus on learning the many uses of CSS and how it adds layers to the skeleton in terms of beautification
 - Early to Mid July: Work on how HTML and CSS mesh together for the front-end visuals
 - Late July to August: Focus on adding functionality through Javascript, JSON, and basic knowledge of Web Storage

I hope that by showing the iteration of my learning and developing, it shows how determine I am to learning the fundatmental and 
taking the time to do it properly through my efforts
